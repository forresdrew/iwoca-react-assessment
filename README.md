# DEVELOPER NOTES

Unfortunately just completely ran out of time here. Tried to rush through to the finish line quickly so I'd have time for tidy up and Unit tests. Ran into an issue very quickly trying to pull data from the localhost3001 which I didn't resolve until the hour mark!

Hopefully you get the gist of the tests I would have like to have written. Would ultimately want separate test files for each component
